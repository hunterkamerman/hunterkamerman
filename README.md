Hunter's GitHub README
Introduction

Hey there! I'm Hunter, a farmer from Bridger, Montana. In addition to running our family dairy, I'm also a tech enthusiast, and I'm excited to break into the industry. This GitHub README will give you a brief overview of my skills, experience, and current projects.
Experience

I've been working with WordPress since 2016, building websites both as a hobby and for clients. Through this experience, I've gained proficiency in PHP, as well as a basic understanding of JavaScript (JS) and CSS. My WordPress projects have allowed me to develop skills in web development, content management, and customization.
Current Focus

At the moment, I'm focusing on expanding my knowledge of JS frameworks and building projects using them. I believe that JS frameworks can greatly enhance the functionality and user experience of websites, and I'm eager to dive deeper into this area. By leveraging frameworks such as React, Vue.js, or Angular, I aim to create more dynamic and interactive web applications.
